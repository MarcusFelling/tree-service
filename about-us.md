Hello and welcome to my “about me” page! My name is Lucas Felling, and I am the founder of Felling Tree Service. I started this business because I enjoy the physical challenges of the job, the satisfaction of a job well done, and the opportunity to work in the great outdoors.

Today, Felling Tree Service is a thriving business with a team of skilled professionals who share my passion for tree care. We offer a wide range of services, including tree removal, pruning, stump grinding, and storm damage cleanup. We are committed to providing safe, efficient, and high-quality services to our customers.

At Felling Tree Service, we take pride in our work and strive to exceed our customers’ expectations. We use state-of-the-art equipment and techniques to ensure the safety of our workers, our customers, and their property. Our team is fully insured and licensed, and we follow strict safety protocols to ensure that every job is completed safely and efficiently.

Thank you for taking the time to learn about me and Felling Tree Service. If you have any questions or would like to schedule a tree care service, please don’t hesitate to contact us. We look forward to hearing from you!
